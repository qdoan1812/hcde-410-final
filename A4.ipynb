    "# I. Motivation and problem statement:\n",
    "Since the emergence of data storage and usage over time by private companies, the threats of data breaches have always been a critical  issue, costing both direct financial impacts for industries and indirect impact of personal information stolen to the users of those companies. As a result, I'm planning to do this analysis in order to investigate which type of industry is most targeted for data breaching, if there's any considerable difference between the number of records lost for each type of data breach and how this trend changed over time. I believe gaining a deeper insight into this would help prospective industries to be more conscious of the risks they might face regarding data breach, and to implement approriate legal procedures as well as security procedures fast enough to protect the victimm's personal information in times of crisis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# II. Data selected for analysis:\n",
    "For this analysis, I'm gonna use the dataset about data breaches report from the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (PRC), which can be found at this link: https://privacyrights.org/data-breaches. This dataset specifies the type of breach and the type of businesses and organizations associated with each incident from 2005 to 2018, with more than 9000 breach events. The license of this data is of Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), meaning it allows me to copy the material in any format and transform, build upon that material. This dataset is suitable for addressing my research goal because it has data on which exact type of data breach for each event, associated with each organization, allowing me to analyze the trend of data breaches by type and by  industry over time. Another dataset that I'm going to use is this dataset from Information is Beautiful which contains over 370 selected events among 30,000 data breaches events from 2004 to 2021, it can be found at this link: https://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/worlds-biggest-data-breaches-hacks/ This dataset contains more up-to-date data breaches events compared to the first one. This license of this data is also of Creative Commons license (CC), allowing me to use and build upon the dataset of this organization. This dataset provides the number of records lost during later events and help me identify the trend of data breaching more recently. One possible ethical consideration for both these dataset is that they also included each company's name for each event, thus, I wouldn't specify directly any company in this report in order to avoid breaking down their reputation without their awareness.\n",
    "\n",
    "# III. Unknowns and dependencies:\n",
    "There are some factors that outside of my control that might impact my ability to complete this project by the end of the quarter, including having a difficult time using python on Jupiter Notebook to do my analysis, which would take more time than I expected, another problem is that I would have to find another dataset about data breach cost to answer one of my research question and I wouldnn't find the suitable dataset for that. \n"

    "# IV. Research questions (or hypotheses):\n",
    "The hypothesis in the course of my research project is that data breaches caused by external reasons are more detrimental: causing the most lost in record numbers, than internal reasons. The second hypothesis is that hacking comprises mainly of the total data breaches events. The third hypothesis is that these breaches are most targeted at businesses such as financial and insurance services since these businesses make the most profit compared to other types of businesses. \n",
    "The 5 Research Questions that I'm attempting to answer are:\n",
    "1.  Between external reasons and internal reasons for data breaches, which type caused more lost in data records from 2004 to 2021?\n",
    "2. How have the trends for internal attacks and external attacks for data breaches progressed from 2004 to 2021?\n",
    "3. What is the distribution of breaches by specific types? \n",
    "4. What types of businesses are most targeted by hacking breaches attacks?\n",
    "5. How have the trends for hacking breaches aimed at organizations changed from 2005 to 2018?\n",
    "\n",
    "# V. Background and/or Related Work:\n",
    "The loss of personal and senstive information regarding the users and/or the companies has led to significant reputational damage as well as financial losses. According to the IBM’s 2016 Cost of Data Breach Study, the average cost of a data breach has reached $4 million. According to this article (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/widm.1211), the conclusions that they reached after analysing the statistics of data leak incidents from 2011 to 2016 from Identity Theft Resource Center is that data leakage has been increasing, with business and medical/healthcare leaks take the majority of the leaks. Moreover, from the figure that they included, the number of breaches caused by outsiders (hackers, etc) in 2016 takes around 55% of the overall incident. This article also stated that according to other reports, there has been a threat of insiders causing data leak in recent years, with more than 40% of breaches perpetrated from inside a company. According to another report of Verizon DBIR Team in 2020 analyzing both incidents and breaches collected from a variety of sources using the VERIS framework (https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/2020/introduction/), it has also confirmed that external attackers are considerably more common than are internal attackers, with Financial being the primary motive. The actors of these breaches come primarily from phishing and credential theft, particularly from “Social” and “Hacking” subsections respectively. Thus, these finidings have informed me to come up with my hypothesis and research questions stated above, to investigate the overall trend of data breaches more recently in terms of the types of businesses most targeted and the types of attackers behind them. \n",
    "\n",
    "# VI. Methodology:\n",
    "Firstly, the data are compiled from PRC and Information is Beautiful into 2 different tsv files and saved into 2 lists of dictionaries. Secondly, sum, percentage, and average methods are applied to this data to answer the research questions stated above. Then, I would use a bar graph and a pie chart in order to compare directly the numbers against each other, partcularly for question 1, question 3 and question 4. Additionaly, for identifying trends over the years: question 2 and question 5, I would use time series graphs against a range of years from 2018 to 2021 and from 2005 to 2018 respectively in order to identify the patterns for internal attacks vs external attacks as well as trends for hacking breaches of each organization. This method of presenting my results as a graph is useful because it allows me to visualize and analyze the trends over time."

This is the largest hacking and identity theft case ever prosecuted by the U.S. Department of Justice. An indictment was returned on Aug. 5, 2008. Conspirators obtained the credit and debit card numbers by wardriving and hacking into the wireless computer networks of major retailers -- including TJX Companies, BJ\\'s Wholesale Club, OfficeMax, Boston Market, Barnes & Noble, Sports Authority, Forever 21 and DSW. The indictments are the result of a three-year undercover investigation conducted out of the San Diego Field Office of the U.S. Secret Service. UPDATE (8/30/2008): TrustCo BankCorp NY sued TJX in August 2008 to recoup costs it incurred from reissuing an estimated 4,000 customer MasterCard debit cards after hackers accessed the TJX computer network. The bank stated its cost for the breach was up to $20 per affected account, explaining that it suffered losses from administrative expenses and lost interest and transaction fees. Later in the month, TJX in turn claimed that Trustco failed to implement policies or procedures that would have enabled the bank to avoid canceling and replacing customer debit cards. UPDATE (9/22/2008):One of the 11 people arrested last month in connection with the massive data theft at T JX Companies Inc., BJ Wholesale Clubs Inc. and several other retailers pleaded guilty yesterday to four felony counts, including wire and credit card fraud and aggravated identity theft. Many of the Internet attacks that he facilitated were SQL injection attacks, according to court documents. The stolen data was sold to cyber criminals in Eastern Europe and the U.S. or used to make fraudulent credit and debit cards. UPDATE (6/26/2009): TJX has agreed to pay $9.75 million to 41 states and to implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program, designed to safeguard consumer data and address any weaknesses in TJX\\'s systems in place at the time of the breach. Of the $9.75 million monetary payment under the settlement, $5.5 million is to be dedicated to data protection and consumer protection efforts by the states, and $1.75 million is to reimburse the costs and fees of the investigation. Further, $2.5 million of the settlement will fund a Data Security Trust Fund to be used by the state Attorneys General to advance enforcement efforts and policy development in the field of data security and protecting consumers’ personal information.

The money primarily will be used to cover the banks\\' expenses in pursuing the legal action.UPDATE (12/15/2009):A Miami hacker who had already pleaded guilty to computer fraud and identity theft for breaches at retailers T.J. Maxx, OfficeMax, and many other merchants, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to similar charges related to breaches at Heartland Payment Systems, 7-11, Hannaford Brothers supermarkets, and two other companies. Albert Gonzalez, 28, reiterated terms of a plea agreement in U.S. District Court in Boston. A week earlier, co-conspirator Stephen Watt of New York, appeared in that same court and was ordered to serve two years in prison and pay $171.5 million in restitution for developing a sniffing program used to grab payment card data in the breach at the TJX companies between 2003 and 2008. UPDATE (3/17/2010): Humza Zaman, a co-conspirator in the hack of TJX and other companies, was sentenced in Boston to 46 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the conspiracy. The sentence matches what prosecutors were seeking. Zaman was charged with laundering between $600,000 and $800,000 for hacker Albert Gonzalez, who is currently awaiting sentencing on charges that he and others hacked into TJX, Office Max, Heartland Payment Systems and numerous other companies to steal data on more than 100 million credit and debit card accounts. Zaman pleaded guilty in April to one count of conspiracy. His sentence includes three years of supervised release with the condition that Zaman must disclose his conviction to any future employer. Upon release, Zaman will not be barred from using computers. Zaman is the second conspirator in the TJX case to be charged. Former Morgan Stanley coder, Stephen Watt, was sentenced in December to two years in prison for his role in the TJX case, which involved supplying Gonzalez with a sniffer program used to siphon card data from the TJX network.\\xa0UPDATE\\xa0(3/29/2010): A 28-year-old college dropout who became the world’s biggest credit card hacker on Thursday was sentenced to 20 years in prison for stealing millions of credit union and bank account records from TJX Cos., BJ’s Wholesale Club, Office Max, Dave & Busters, Barnes & Noble and a string of other companies – even as he was working as a $75,000-a-year undercover informant for the U.S. government in identity theft cases. But that’s not the end of it, as Albert Gonzalez is scheduled to be sentenced again to additional years behind bars for additional data thefts at Heartland Payment Systems, Hannaford Bros. supermarkets and 7-Eleven convenience stores. The theft of credit card data cost financial institutions, insurers and cardholders an estimated $200 million, according to law enforcement. JC Penney and Wet Seal were both officially added to the list of retail victims of Albert Gonzalez on Friday (March 26) when U.S. District Court Judge Douglas P. Woodlock refused to continue their cloak of secrecy and removed the seal from their names. StorefrontBacktalk had reported last August that $17 billion JC Penney chain was one of Gonzalez.s victims, even though JC Penney\\'s media representatives were denying it. But the $561 million chain Wet Seal, which has 504 stores in 47 states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico, had kept their identity secret. No more and that.s the way Woodlock wanted it.\\xa0UPDATE\\xa0(4/16/2010): Damon Patrick Toey, the \\'trusted subordinate\\' of TJX hacker Albert Gonzalez, was sentenced in Boston to 5 more years in prison. He also received a $100,000 fine and three years. supervised release, according to the Justice Department.UPDATE (7/8/2010): TJX has settled another lawsuit.\\xa0 The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees\\' Retirement System, a shareholder of TJX stock, settled with TJX for $595,000 in legal fees and enhanced oversight of customer files.UPDATE (4/8/2011):\\xa0Albert Gonzalez is appealing his conviction for his role in a large data breach by claiming that his actions were authorized by the Secret Service. \\xa0The government acknowledged that Gonzalez was a key undercover Secret Service informant at the time of the breaches. \\xa0In a 25-page petition, Gonzalez faulted one of his attorney\\'s for failing to prepare a \"Public Authority\" defense, which would have argued that he committed crimes with the approval of government authorities.', 'Information Source': 'Dataloss DB', 'Source URL': '', 'Year of Breach': '2007', 'Latitude': '42.291762', 'Longitude': '-71.425895', '': ''}, {'Date Made Public': '1/25/2007', 'Company': 'Clay High School', 'City': 'Oregon', 'State': 'Ohio', 'Type of breach': 'HACK', 'Type of organization': 'EDU', 'Total Records': '0', 'Description of incident': 'A former high school student              obtained sensitive staff and student information through an apparent              security breach.

The figure includes a settlement totaling nearly $60 million with Visa, another of about $3.5 million with American Express and more than $26 million in legal fees. That total also includes $42.8 million that Heartland has set aside to fund proposed settlements with several other litigants over the breach. One example of what the fund is set up for is Heartland's offer to settle several consumer class action lawsuits against it for four million. So far, Heartland has recovered about $30 million from insurance companies.UPDATE (06/02/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has made a third settlement deal, this time with MasterCard, related to a massive data breach two years ago at the card payments processor. As part of the deal, Heartland has agreed to pay as much as US$41.1 million to MasterCard issuers that lost money as a result of the data breach. The deal is contingent on financial institutions representing 80 percent of the affected MasterCard accounts accepting the offer by June 25. MasterCard is recommending that issuers accept the offer.UPDATE (09/01/2010): Heartland Payment Systems has agreed to settle with Discover for five million dollars.\\xa0 Discover will use the money to cover costs of fraud incidents and reissuing cards.UPDATE (09/19/2010): Jerome Abaquin Gonzales is expected to surrender to police and serve jail time for participating in a credit card forgery ring which used information from the Heartland breach.\\xa0 The information came from the 4.2 million Discover credit card customers who used their cards at Hannaford Brothers.UPDATE (09/22/2010): Thomas Michio Taniguchi was sentenced to prison for his role in the forgery ring in which Jerome Abaquin Gonzales also participated.UPDATE (12/07/2011): Heartland legal representatives were able to successfully argue that most of the claims against Heartland that were filed by nine banks should be dismissed. All but one claim was dismissed.UPDATE\\xa0(02/12/2012): The nine banks may have had their claims against Heartland dismissed because Heartland reported that sharing a contractual relationship with the banks defeats their appeal. However, the credit-card-issuing banks are arguing that a New Jersey economic loss rule only bars claims for foreseeable economic losses when the parties are in a contractual relationship and does not bar their negligence claim against Heartland.UPDATE\\xa0(07/25/2013): Five more foreign hackers were charged for their role in stealing information from Heartland Payment Systems, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, JetBlue, and J.C.

In that story I mentioned True Health was one of three major healthcare providers with similar website problems, and that the other two providers didn’t even require a login to view all patient records. Today we’ll examine a flaw that was just fixed by Molina Healthcare, a Fortune 500 company that until recently was exposing countless patient medical claims to the entire Internet without requiring any authentication.In April 2017 I received an anonymous tip from a reader who said he’d figured out that just by changing a single number in the Web address\\xa0when accessing his recent medical claim at MolinaHealthcare.com he could then view any and all other patient claims.More alarmingly, the link he was given to access his claim with Molina was accessible to anyone who had the link; no authentication was required to view it. Nor was any authentication required to view any other records that could be accessed by fiddling with the numbers after the bit at the end of Molinahealthcare.com address (e.g., claimID=123456789).In other words, having access to a single hyperlink to a patient record would allow an attacker to enumerate and download all other claims. The source showed me screenshots of his medical records at Molina, and how when he changed a single number in the URL it happily displayed another patient’s records.The records did not appear to include Social Security numbers, but they do include patient names, addresses and dates of birth, as well as potentially sensitive information that may point to specific diseases, such as medical procedure codes and any prescribed medications.I contacted Molina about the issue, and the company released a brief statement saying it had fixed the problem.

Sony believes an unauthorized person has obtained names, addresses, email addresses, dates of birth, PlayStation Network/Qriocity password and login, and handle/PSN online IDs for multiple users. The attacker may have also stolen users\\' purchase history, billing address, and password security questions. User credit card numbers may have also been obtained. Sony has hired a security firm to investigate the incident and strengthen the network infrastructure by re-building their system to provide greater protection of personal information.An individual filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of all PSN users following seven days of a Sony PlayStation Network outage.  The lawsuit alleges that Sony \"failed to encrypt data and establish adequate firewalls to handle a server intrusion contingency, failed to provide prompt and adequate warnings of security breaches, and unreasonably delayed in bringing the PSN service back on line.\"  It also accused Sony of violating the Payment Card Industry (PCI) security standard, which prohibits companies from storing cardholder data.UPDATE\\xa0(5/3/2011): A review of Sony\\'s network breach revealed that it was larger than first thought.

Customer names, credit or debit card numbers, card expiration dates, and card security codes were taken and have appeared on the black market.UPDATE (12/24/2013): Target now faces at least three class-action lawsuits as a result of the breach.  A wave of scam artists are attempting to profit from the breach by posing as Target or bank representatives addressing the breach.  People who shopped at Target are being warned not to give their information out over the phone.  Target is working with the U.S. Department of Justice and the Secret Service to investigate the breach.UPDATE (12/27/2013): Target customers are also being warned to be suspicious of emails claiming to be from Target or banks that request personal information.

(Source CA Attorney Generals\\' Office)UPDATE (1/10/2014): Target Corp. says that up to 70 million people were affected by the data breach, significantly more than was originally suspected. Experts predict the numbers could climb even higher than 70 million once the company completes its investigation. UPDATE (1/13/2014): Target Corp. has confirmed that malware was found on the Point of Sale devices. The malware has been removed. The number of individuals affected are now said to be 110 million individuals, 70 million more than originally thought.UPDATE (1/13/2014): Security experts are stating that Target may not be alone in the data breach. Neiman Marcus and at least 3 other unnamed retailers (these retailers are thought to be located in Eastern Europe) may also have been compromised as federal investigators track what they believe to be an international crime ring. UPDATE (1/14/2014): Companies that help Target process payments could be facing millions of dollars in fines and costs as a result of the data breach.UPDATE (1/16/2014): The malware that infected in the Target POS systems has been found and is known as the Trojan.POSRAM, according to new report by investigators. \"The malware is a memory-scraping tool that grabs card data directly from point-of-sale terminals and then stores it on the victims system for later retrieval\". The malware was originally thought to have been developed in Russia, known as BlackPOS. This new version is considered to be highly customized so that current anitvirus programs would not have detected it as reported by investigative agencies.UPDATE (1/20/2014): \"A 17 year-old Russian national from St. Petersburg is thought to be responsible for the malicious programming that allowed for data from Target and Neiman Marcus to be compromised,\" according to a California based security firm.UPDATE (1/21/2014): Two Mexican citizens were arrested at the border in South Texas for the purchase of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise with information stolen during the Target security breach, as reported by a South Texas police chief.A spokesman with the Secret Service announced that the investigation is ongoing into the possibility of a link between the Target breach and the two arrested in Texas. UPDATE (1/29/2014): The malware used in the Target attack could suggest a poorly secured feature built into a popular IT management software product that was running on the retailers internal newtork.UPDATE (1/29/2014):  A Target Corp. investor filed suit in Minnesota federal court Wednesday, against the retailers Executives holding them liable for damage caused by the holiday season data breach that saw hackers steal personal and financial information from tens of millions of customers.Shareholder Maureen Collier filed the suite with a complaint alleging that Target\\'s board and top executives harmed the company financially by failing to take adequate steps to prevent the cyberattack then by subsequently providing customers with incomplete and misleading information about the extent of the data theft.\"The suit brings claims of breach of fiduciary duty, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets and abuse of control, and seeks monetary damages on behalf of the company from the 14 named officers and directors\".UPDATE (2/5/2014): Hackers who broke into Target\\'s computer network and stole customers\\'  financial and personal data used credentials alledgedly\\xa0 were stolen from a  heating and air conditioning subcontractor in Pennsylvania, according to  digital security journalist Brian Krebs.It appears as though the air conditioning company was given access to Target\\'s  computer network in order for the vendor to make remote changes to the system to\\xa0 cut heating and cooling costs. Target has not confirmed the accuracy of this report.UPDATE (2/6/2014): Target Corporation announced they are fast tracking new credit card security technology in their stores, 6 months earlier than originally planned. Target\\'s CFO announced it is moving up its goal to utilize chip-enabled smart cards,  and now plans to have them in stores by early 2015. These cards encrypt point of sale data,  rendering the credit card number less useful if stolen. Currently this technology is more prevalent outide of the US, but have resulted in  lower card number thefts in other countries, notably Canada and the  United Kingdom.UPDATE (2/15/2014): The breach at the Target Copr. that exposed credit card and personal data on more than 110 million consumers appears to have begun with a malware-laced email phishing attack sent to employees at the HVAC contractor Fazio Mechanical in Sharpsburg Pennsylvania. According to Krebs on Security, \"multiple sources close to the investigation now tell this reporter that those credentials were stolen in an email malware attack at Fazio that began at least two months before thieves started stealing card data from thousands of Target cash registers.\"UPDATE (5/5/2014): Target\\'s CEO has resigned in the wake of the data breach over the holiday season. He is claiming the breach was his fault. He is the second major executive to resign. Earlier in the year the company\\'s Chief Technology Office resigned as well. The CFO of the company will take over as the interim CEO.UPDATE (8/7/2014): Target has announced that the data breach will cost it\\'s shareholders $148 million. UPDATE (12/9/2014): A Minnesota ruled that a lawsuit put forth by several banks could proceed as the court stated that Target failed to adequately defend against the massive data breach they suffered.

When the campus detected a vulnerability in one of these areas in November, the campus began installing and testing a security fix — known as a patch — which can take weeks, Rivers said during the press call. During this process, attackers were able to discover a security flaw and gained access to the system.BFS contains the information of about 50 percent of current students and 65 percent of active employees. Affected individuals largely include students, faculty and staff who received payments from the campus, mainly through electronic fund transfers. Those who received paper payments, however, may have also been affected.A private computer investigation firm was retained by the campus to further determine whether personal information was compromised. The campus will send notice letters in the mail with more information about free credit monitoring and insurance to those who were potentially impacted starting Friday.According to Rivers, this is the third significant breach UC Berkeley has seen in the past five years.Within a day of the unauthorized intrusion Dec. 28, the campus’s security team had detected and began efforts to contain the attack, according to campus spokesperson Janet Gilmore.Once campus IT staff identified the unauthorized access, they forensically preserved copies of the system for investigation purposes and took affected servers offline for about two weeks to prevent further access.

Security researcher and Haveibeenpwned  owner Troy Hunt recently found a database containing the stolen account  information for sale on a dark web market site and listed the breach on  his own site as the third largest ever. A hacker known as Peace was selling the database for $150, according to Vice\\'s Motherboard.  Peace told Motherboard the price is so low because the salted passwords  are very difficult to crack however, Hunt told the publication roughly  half of the passwords will likely be cracked due to weak password  protections that were used at the time.  On May 12, Tumblr notified  users of the breach that compromised user email addresses with salted  and hashed passwords from early 2013 and told users there is no reason  to believe that the information was used to access their Tumblr  accounts. Although the breach isn\\'t as bad as other major breaches, it has the  potential to be dangerous for users who re-use passwords, Kaspersky Lab  Senior Security Researcher Brian Bartholomew told SCMagazine.com via  email.  “If you were to think about how many users from Tumblr have Apple  cloud accounts, Twitter accounts, Gmail or other online mail accounts,  etc. the potential risk is high for this breach to bleed over into other  stories down the road,” he said.\\xa0 “These credentials could be used by  criminals to access anything from bank accounts, to mail accounts, to  other online systems that may house personal data / pictures / etc.” Bartholomew also said the credentials could be used to carry out phishing attacks, targeting and extortion.\"More information: https://www.scmagazine.com/tumblr-accounts-from-2013-breach-for-sale-on-...', 'Information Source': 'Media', 'Source URL': '', 'Year of Breach': '2016', 'Latitude': '40.712784', 'Longitude': '-74.005941', '': ''}, {'Date Made Public': '5/17/2016', 'Company': 'LinkedIn', 'City': 'Mountain View', 'State': 'California', 'Type of breach': 'HACK', 'Type of organization': 'BSO', 'Total Records': '117,000,000', 'Description of incident': 'A recent incident involving LinkedIn, the business-oriented social  networking service, is showing that data breaches can cause big problems  for companies and consumers — even years after the breaches take place.  On May 17, 2016, LinkedIn discovered that information stolen in a 2012  incident was being made available online, and notified site users immediately the next day about what happened and what they were doing to fix it. In 2012, an alleged 117 million  email and password combinations were stolen by hackers. At the time,  LinkedIn issued a mandatory password reset for any accounts they thought  were compromised; all LinkedIn members were encouraged to change their  passwords as well, just in case. Fast forward to present day, and the 2012 breach has come back to  haunt LinkedIn. The stolen data popped up online, and in an e-mail to  LinkedIn users sent on May 25, 2016, the company said the published  information included email addresses, hashed passwords, and LinkedIn  member IDs, which are an internal identifier LinkedIn assigns to each  member profile. They immediately invalidated passwords of all LinkedIn  accounts that were created prior to the 2012 breach and had not  undergone a password reset since the breach. LinkedIn’s attempts to protect users, however, are extending beyond  resetting passwords this time. They are also using automated tools to  try and identify (and block) any suspicious activity on specific  LinkedIn accounts. The proper authorities have been contacted and  LinkedIn is working with law enforcement. They have demanded that anyone  making stolen password data available must stop immediately, or face  potential legal action. In their e-mail, the company also shared that they have improved  security features since the 2012 breach, which will hopefully prevent  another incident like this from happening in the future. As examples,  they noted that they use salted hashes to store passwords and offer two-step verification  for members who are interested in additional security. LinkedIn also  encouraged members to use strong passwords and to change them regularly.  If you don’t change your password often enough because you have trouble  remembering new passwords, consider using a password manager, which can help you\\xa0keep all of your passwords organized.More information: https://www.identityforce.com/blog/linkedin-data-breach-continues-cause-...', 'Information Source': 'Media', 'Source URL': '', 'Year of Breach': '2016', 'Latitude': '37.386052', 'Longitude': '-122.083851', '': ''}, {'Date Made Public': '5/19/2016', 'Company': 'Milwaukee Bucks', 'City': 'Milwaukee', 'State': 'Wisconsin', 'Type of breach': 'HACK', 'Type of organization': 'BSO', 'Total Records': '0', 'Description of incident': \"The Milwaukee Bucks have notified players of a data breach when someone posing as the team's president sent a spoofing email requesting information on the players W2 forms.The information compromised included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, compensation figures and dates of birth.

    "I used  this CSV  file  to  make  a  time  graph  series in Google Sheets in  order  to  analyze  the  overall hacking breaches evolution over time from 2005 to 2019. I found that from 2005 to 2013, the number of breaches remain stable for all types of organizations. However, since 2013, there's a sharp increase in in attacks against the Medical sector. Then there is a decrease in 2015 and another increase in 2016. These fluctuations reflect the different crypto-attacks that Medical services have reported in the past: for example the Cryptolocker in 2014 and the TeslaCrypt in 2016. For hacking breaches targeted at Business (BSO) sector, I found that there's a crucial increase from 2013 and 2017 followed by a sharp decrease in 2018.

    "## Limitations: \n",
    "Certain limitations implied in my study are that I had to use data from two different datasets to answer my hypothesis and they overlap each other, with one having records from 2005 to 2018 and one having records from 2004 to 2021. These datasets contain different information and volume of records regarding hacking breack events. Thus the choice of the dataset to answer my hypotheses can influence the findings I extract after analyzing the statistics and patterns to answer certain research questions. Second limitation in my study is that the data from Information is Beautiful dataset could potentially not contain enough breaches events considering it only has more than 300 events compared to more than 9000 events in PRC, and also it could be biased since it didn't come from a non-profit organization, in contrast to PRC. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implications:\n",
    "However, the findings from my study are in line with various previous studies and reports. As chronicled in my study, the comprehensive analysis revealed that in contrast to what companies are often afraid of, external attacks have always outnumbered internal attacks in terms of lost records and data. The time graph showed that even though the number of internal attacks have increased during the last few years, the number of external attacks have consistently been more than double of that of internal attacks from 2004 to 2021. Thus, the implication is that companies should focus more on strengthening their security standards to protect data breach from outsiders but also consider putting into place stricter rules to make sure there are huge consequences for internal breaches intentionally and unintentionally so that employees are more conscious of their own protection of companies' data. The second finding is that hacking have always been in the top methods behind these data breach attacks, however, contrary to my theory, hacking attacks have targeted not only at Business organizations but also Medical institutions. This can be explained because health organizations hold a lot confidential and sensitive data. This data is often sold and used for spamming for commercial compaigns. The implication for this is that upon transitioning from a paper-based system to digitized and distributive healthcare data, healthcare organizations shouldn't complacent because businesses hold more financial values. Nowadays the values lie more in the personalized data and not monetary. Thus, they should also invest in installing a secure database and also proper technical training for medical employees as well.

    "From my analysis of data breach records from 2004 to 2021 encountered on multiple organizations, one of my main findings is that external attacks caused more detrimental loss in records and data compared to internal attacks. Another finding that appears is that hacking methods are most commonly used by these attackers and that the most targetted type of organization are medical organizations and BSOs since they possess the most sensitive personal data. These findings imply that taking serious action to secure personal data and proper training of employees, especially for MED and BSO organizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Future research upon this study include identifying the main locations from which the confidential data are breached by hacking methods, for example via network servers, emails, etc. We should also research more on the preventive measurements that the organizations could take depending on their financial and technical ability so as to avoid as much data breaches as possible."
