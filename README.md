Analysis on Data Breaches Trends Over time:

I'm going to examine the dataset containing details on what type of data breach and what type of organization associated with each event on over 9000 reports from 2005 to 2018 from the PRC source and the dataset from Information is Beautiful which contains over 30,000 data breaches events from 2004 to 2021 which contains more up-to-date data breaches events. My hypotheses for this research project are data breaches caused by external reasons are more detrimental (causing the most lost in record numbers and/or financial aspects) than internal reasons and that these breaches are most targeted at businesses such as financial and insurance services since these businesses make the most profit compared to other types of businesses.
